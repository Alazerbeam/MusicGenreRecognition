All of the data is in this shared Google Drive folder.

Here are the files included within this shared folder:

“README” - This document which explains each file in the shared folder.
“Archive” - The dataset that I used for this project.
“CS_549_Class_Project” - The Google Colab including all source code and descriptions of each section of the code. Also has images for data visualization, training and testing processes.
“Lizerbram_ML_Project_Slides” - The presentation slides that I made for this project.
“CS_549_Final_Project” - The final report which explains all aspects of the project and includes the images shown in the Google Colab. In the report I go into much more detail about the training process and the results.
